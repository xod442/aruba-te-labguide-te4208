# Summary and Feedback

## Feedback and Next Steps

We hope that you were able to see the power of deploying a fully stateful and 4th generation network fabric.  

During this hands-on Test Drive, you used the Aruba Fabric Composer to build out a new Fabric, discover new CX 10000 switches, integrate with VMware vSphere and the AMD Pensando Policy and Services Manager..  

In addition to building the Layer 2 and 3 fabric, we added security, firewalling and telemetry directly to the Fabric!  The Microsegmentation lab demonstrated how you can set up hyperscaler like security within your own data center fabric.  

We would love to hear from you and gather your feedback to help us improve future labs.  Please use the survey below to provide your feedback:
