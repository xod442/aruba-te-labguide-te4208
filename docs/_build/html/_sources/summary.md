# Summary and Feedback

## Feedback and Next Steps

We hope that you were able to see the power of deploying a fully stateful and 4th generation network fabric.  

During this hands-on Lab, you used the HPE Aruba Netwroking Fabric Composer to create the underlay and overlay network and deploy evpn layer 2 & 3 virtual network identifiers.  You created endpoint goups and configugured firewall policies to permit shh and deny all other traffic.

This hands on lab demonstrates how to get different layer 2 vlans to communicate with each other using Integrated Route Bridge, or IRB. You were able to test the security policies and modify them to allow ssh from the database servers to the webservers. 

We would love to hear from you and gather your feedback to help us improve future labs.  Please use the survey below to provide your feedback:
