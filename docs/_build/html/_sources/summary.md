## Feedback and Next Steps

We hope that you were able to see the power of deploying a fully stateful and 4th generation network fabric.  

During this hands-on Test Drive, you used the Aruba Fabric Composer to define endpoint groups, rules, and policies.
Additionally, security, firewalling, and telemetry were programed directly into the Fabric!  The Microsegmentation lab demonstrated how you can set up hyperscaler like security within your own data center fabric.  

We would love to hear from you and gather your feedback to help us improve future labs.  Please use the survey below to provide your feedback:
