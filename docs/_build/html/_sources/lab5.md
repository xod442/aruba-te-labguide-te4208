# Lab 5 - Microsegmentation

## Lab Overview

Lab time:  40 minutes

In the previous labs, we built a fabric, attached switches, and added integrations with vSphere and the PSM.  There are several workload VMs running in each lab and during this lab, we will levarage the integrations to build firewall policies to microsegment the workloads from each other.

## Lab 5.1 - Create Endpoint Group for Workloads

### Description
In this task, you will create 2 endpoint groups. An endpoint group in Fabric Composer is a set of VMs that have the same set of policy rules.

### Validate

1. Using the AFC, select **Policy** and then **Enpoint Groups** from the top level menu

![Endpoint Groups Menu](images/lab4-endpoint-groups-menu.png)  
_Fig. Lab 5 Endpoint Groups Menu_  

2. From the **ACTIONS** menu, select **Add**  
If there are existing endpoint groups, just ignore them.

## Lab 5.2 - Create Firewall Rule

### Description
When enabling Microsegmentation, an explicit Deny All rule is placed at the bottom of the rule list, which acts as a catch all. For the purpose of these labs and in order to test the Switch Firewalling functionality, we will place an **Allow All** rule at the bottom, and add specific Deny rules above it.

### Validate

1. Using the AFC, select **Policy** and then **Rules** from the top level menu, or if still visible, select **Rules** from the left menu.

2. From the **ACTIONS** menu, select **Add** to add a new Rule

## Lab 5.3 - Create Firewall Policy

### Description
Firewall Rules are placed in Policies and are enforced in a top to bottom fashion.  We will create a Policy in this lab, and assign our Allow All rule to it.

### Validate

1. Using the AFC, select **Policy** and then **Policies** from the top level menu, or if still visible, select **Policies** from the left menu.

2. From the **ACTIONS** menu, select **Add** to add a new Rule

## Lab 5.4 - Configure Microsegmentation

### Description
A microsegmentation is a set of configurations starting with a private/isolated VLAN on the host that extends to the switch. On the switch, that VLAN is redirected to the Pensando DSM processor for policy enforcement.  

We will use the Microsegmentation Configuration in Fabric Composer which will:
- Creates, on the host:
  - A Distributed Virtual Switch
  - Two Port Groups:  one for the private primary VLAN and another for the isolated VLAN 
- Creates, between the host and the Switches:
  - A Link Aggregation Group transporting that VLAN (as a promiscuous port)

### Validate

1. Using the AFC, we will use the Guided Setup menu on the right side.  Go to **DISTRIBUTED SERVICES** and select **CONFIGURE MICROSEGMENTATION**

## Lab 5 Summary

- During this lab, we enabled microsegmentation on the CX 10000 switches  
- We created Endpoint Groups for each of the workloads running in the lab  
  - We used VM Tags for matching to demostrate how to create dynamic firewall rules
- We created an Allow All firewall rule  
- We created a firewall policy and added the Allow All rule to that policy  
- We use the AFC to activate Microsegmentation  
  - We created a Private VLAN and added our test workload vNICs to this new Private VLAN  to ensure VM isolation 

## Lab 5 Learning Check 

- Endpoint Groups can be created manually or automatically learned from VMware
- Rules are added to policies. 
- Policies are atuomatically sent to the AMD Pensando Policy Services Manager(PSM)
- PSM programs the DPU chips on the HPE Aruba CX 10000 switch
