<h1>HPE Aruba Networking Micro Data Centers with CX10K</h1>

<h2>Technical Enablement Hands-On Lab Guide</h2>

# Lab Overview
The popularity of micro data centers is on the rise. Edge data can have a very short shelf life. Sometimes the data needs to collected and analyzed at the edge. To run the applications found in a hyperscale data center, the micro data center needs to be robust and secure. During this session you will deploy a micro data center (MDC). Your MDC will be built out of a pair of HPE Aruba CK10 Distributed Services Switches. A layer 2 switch will be added to the core of the MDC as well as a VMware ESX server. Using AFC you will create a new vSwitch in VMware and add VM hosts. Explore adding VMs to endpoint groups and observing the virtual network behavior.

### Introduction  
The Aruba CX 10000 Series Switch introduces a ground-breaking data center switch category known as Distributed Services Switch (DSS). It combines top-notch Aruba CX data center L2/3 switching capabilities with the industry's pioneering hardware accelerated programmable processor, Pensando P4. This remarkable integration enables stateful firewall services to be delivered inline and at scale, offering wire-rate performance and significant enhancements compared to traditional data center L2/3 switches.  

In this workshop, students will have the opportunity to access two of these innovative switches as micro data center. A HPE Aruba Networking 6300 will be used as a layer 2 switch and all the switches will be managed with the HPE Aruba Networking Fabric Composer (AFC), a powerful API-driven, software-defined orchestration solution. Additionally, they will be able to deploy VMware networking and interact with virtual machines.

### Objective
1. Use Aruba Fabric Composer (AFC) to configure LACP connections between switches.
2. Build distributed virtual switch in ESX server 
3. Test network connectivity.
